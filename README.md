# TextMate bundle for Bats tests.

Bash Automated Testing System ([Bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats)) is a test library running in Bash/Shell, created by [@sstephenson](https://github.com/sstephenson).

## Usage

All `.bats` files should automatically be assigned the `Bats` language/grammar. Alternately, you can manually change to it using `⇧^⌥B`.

The following snippets/commands exist:

* `!env` - use at the top of a file to set the environment to `#!/usr/bin/env bats`
* `test` - inserts a `@test "name" { ... }` test block
* `line` - inserts a `[ "${lines[0]}" = "something" ]` assertion

## Installation

Via Git:

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    git clone https://github.com/drnic/Bats.tmbundle.git
    osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'

You can view the source (or fork the project) on GitHub: [https://github.com/drnic/Bats.tmbundle](https://github.com/drnic/Bats.tmbundle)
